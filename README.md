## Implementation of Perceptron algorithm in Java

### What is it? 

Developed by [Frank Rosenblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt).
Perceptron is an algorithm used for supervised learning.<br> Input for the algorithm is array of vectors, and it decides whether that input belongs to a specific class.

### About Implementation

Input the program is 2D array containing 4 vectors and the output is a tweaked Perceptron capable of classifying further inputs.<br> Uncomment the `testRandomInputs()` function to test the Perceptron with randomly generated input vectors.
